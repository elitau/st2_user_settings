        Maps language names **as listed at the beginning of the README** (but all lowercase)
        to executables for non-built in linters. If the executable is not in the default system path,
        or on posix systems is not in /usr/local/bin or ~/bin, then you must specify
        the full path to the executable. Note that paths in Windows must use double
        backslashes, for example "C:\\Program Files (x86)\\nodejs\\node.exe".

        Please note that the map _keys_ do not always match the name of the
        executable, but rather the language syntax for the executable to lint.

        This is the effective default map; your mappings may override these.
